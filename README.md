<strong><u>R Code:</u></strong><br>
<i>R_Code_Drought_Figures.R </i><br>
Code for generating main figures in text. Note that for Figure 4, we renamed the Rank categories in Adobe Illustrator rather than through R.<br>
<br>
<i>R_Code_Drought_Analyses.R </i><br>
Annotated code for all of the statistical analyses in the main text.

<strong><u>Files:</strong></u><br>
<i>Fig1_Data_Rainfall.csv</i><br>
#Summary data of average annual rainfall and average wet season (Dec-May) rainfall for Ankoatsifaka Research Station to generate bar plots of rainfall and Percent Normal Precipitation category lines. Year is defined following Axel and Lewis (2019) as Dec-Nov.
<br><br>
<i>Fig2_Data_Individual_Total_Body_Fat.csv</i><br>
#De-identified data of total body fat measures for the 16 individuals sampled before/during a drought or during/after a drought to generate line graph.
<br><br>
<i>Fig3_Data_Infant_Survival.csv</i><br>
Summary data of percent infant survival to 1 year by year to generate barplots of drought in birth year and weaning year on infant survival.
<br><br>
<i>Fig3_Data_Reproductive_Output.csv</i><br>
#Summary data of percent reproductively-mature females pregnant/giving birth by year to generate barplots of drought in conception year and year prior to conception on reproductive output.
<br><br>
<i>Fig4_Data_Relative_Abundance-Leaves.csv</i><br>
#Summary data averaged across years for proportion of observed trees in each relative abundance category (0,1,2,3,4) by month and drought conditions.
